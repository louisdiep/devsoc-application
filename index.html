  description:
  oil painting is one my hobbies and claude monet is my favourite artist. one of my dreams
  is to see his work in person!

  here are some of the paintings that i've done:


stack of photos
  i LOVE travelling and taking pictures along the way:

  - 1 photo new zealand and japan and thailand/hobart -

  korea and europe are next on my bucket list :)

uniqlo jeans
  i've got a bit of a problem with having too many clothes from uniqlo. their basics are just
  too good!
  these dark wash jeans are my fav piece.

fun facts
marscapone cheese - fav food: tiramisu - italy
  a key ingredient in my favourite dessert - tiramisu!
  aside from the traditional tiramisu, i love making matcha tiramisu as well.
  highly recommend!
  
hojicha powder - current obsession: iced hojicha latte - japan
  iced hojicha lattes are my current obsession. it's roasted green tea so it has
  this really amazing aroma. hottake: it's better than matcha


laptop
  to grind leetcode on the trip!
  jk jk as a cs student i'm taking every opportunity i can to touch grass so this wouldn't have brough this

  that aside, i'm interested in frontend development and ui!
  so far, i've created a more professional personal website - louisdiep - 
  in html, css and javascript.
  unfortunately that's all, but i'd love to do more ;)
